                <dfn title="Star system">Sirius</dfn> is a star system and the brightest star in the Earth's night sky. With a visual apparent  magnitude of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.
            </p>
            <h3><a id="chapter1">Kinematics</a></h3>
            <p>
                In 1718, Edmond Halley discovered the proper motion of the hitherto presumed "fixed" stars after comparing contemporary astrometric measurements with those given in Ptolemy's Almagest. The bright stars Aldebaran, Arcturus and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed 30 arc minutes (about the diameter of the Moon) southwards in 1,800 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1868, Sirius became the first star to have its velocity measured, the beginning of the study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40 km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5 km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.
            </p>
            <h3><a id="chapter2">Distance</a></h3>
            <p>
                In his 1698 book Cosmotheoros, <a href = "ch-huygens/ch-huygens.html">Christiaan Huygens</a> estimated the distance to Sirius at 27664 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light years). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille's observations made at the Cape of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille's observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no sensible parallax); by Bessel (no sensible parallax).
            </p>
            <p>
                Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson was the first to gain some meaningful value using his observations made in 1832–1833 and South African astronomer Thomas Maclear's observations made in 1836–1837, and was published in 1839. The value of the parallax was 0.23 arcseconds, and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or in Henderson's words,"On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less.". Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25 arcseconds for much of the 19th century.

            <h3><a id="chapter3">Visibility</a></h3>
            <img src="../img/sirius-img/sirius-2.jpg" alt="Sirius A and B" class="first-type">
            <p>
                With an apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is the brightest star system in the night sky, almost twice the brightness of the second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13&#176; above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17&#176;, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73&#176; S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting in 9000, Sirius will not be visible any more from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67&#176; and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3 arcseconds and a maximum of 11 arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300 mm (12 in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight nearest stars to the Solar System (not including the Sun), and is the fifth closest stellar system to ours (again not including the Sun). This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as Alpha Centauri and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, Rigel or Betelgeuse. It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun. The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24 ly) away. The Voyager 2 spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four Jovian planets in the Solar System, is expected to pass within 4.3 light-years (1.3 pc) of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.

            <h3><a id="chapter4">System</a></h3>
            <p>
                Sirius is a binary star system consisting of two white stars orbiting each other with a separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940 K.
            </p>
            <h4><a id="chapter5">Sirius A</a></h4>
            <p>
                Sirius A has a mass of 2 M<sub>☉</sub>. The radius of this star has been measured by an astronomical interferometer, giving an estimated angular diameter of 5.936&#177;0.016 mas. The projected rotational velocity is a relatively low 16 km/s,which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk. This is at marked variance with the similar-sized Vega, which rotates at a much faster 274 km/s and bulges prominently around its equator. A weak magnetic field has been detected on the surface of Sirius A.
            </p>
            <h4><a id="chapter6">Sirius B</a></h4>
            <p>
                With a mass nearly equal to the Sun's, Sirius B is one of the more massive white dwarfs known (0.98 M<sub>☉</sub>); it is almost double the 0.5–0.6 M<sub>☉</sub> average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's. The current surface temperature is 25,200 K. Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over more than two billion years.
